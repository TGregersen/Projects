# Projects

This repository will store all of the projects I have been working on as they are completed and functional.  This is primarily for demonstration purposes and my own learning/growth into different languages.  Other repositories will be opened when large projects require them.  Feel free to review my work, I hope to revisit several of these items in the coming months to update them or port them to various languages as learning excersizes.

MinSquaredArea.java
- Generated as part of a code jam/code quiz.  It contains methods to find K nearest X,Y coordinates and find a box with minimal area around those points.  The printed value is the area of the square.

Lawn.js, Lawn.html, style.css
- Generated as part of a game jam. It features a basic and crude UI comprised of colored squares.  The object of the game is to clear the grid of darker squares.  They are regenerated at random.  Avoid water hazards (blue squares).  The Lawn.html and style.css sheets are for testing purposes as they call the java script file in order for the game to play.

Simple_Neural_Network.ipynb
- This is a fille generated from reading a tutorial on Neural Networks (NN).  It served as one of the primers for getting into the process behind how a NN operates.  This file was also one of the first few python files I wrote and executed.
